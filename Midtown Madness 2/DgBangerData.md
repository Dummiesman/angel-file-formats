The *dgBangerData* files are used to define collision properties for
[PKG](PKG.md) objects. These properties define how an object
behaves when something collides with it.

The file names are derived from the name of the [PKG](PKG.md)
and the names of the internal parts of it. The syntax is like this for
the banger data of the entire object:

* `/tune/banger/<pkgname>.dgBangerData`

and like this for the breakable parts:

* `/tune/banger/<pkgname>_<partname>.dgBangerData`

For example, the banger data for the wooden barricade of SF and London, `/geometry/sp_barricadewood_f.pkg`, is defined in the
following files:

* `/tune/banger/sp_barricadewood_f.dgBangerData`
* `/tune/banger/sp_barricadewood_f_BREAK01.dgBangerData`
* `/tune/banger/sp_barricadewood_f_BREAK02.dgBangerData`
* `/tune/banger/sp_barricadewood_f_BREAK03.dgBangerData`
* `/tune/banger/sp_barricadewood_f_BREAK04.dgBangerData`

## Specification

The format is ASCII-based and made up of tag-value rows grouped in
*blocks* between *{* and *}* symbols.

The files start with a definition of the type of banger data given. None
of the MM2 files use anything but *type a*, like this:

```
type: a
```

Next comes the main *dgBangerData* block:

```
dgBangerData {
<tags>
}
```

*<tags>* is replaced by a list of tags from the following table. The
order of the tags is significant, but some tags may be omitted from the
file, in that case the values from *default.dgBangerData* is used.

| Tag           | Format            | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

### CollisionType
CollisionType is a bitfield with the following values.
| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|2     | No collision, only update the physics entity. Mutually exclusive with other collision flags.
|4     | Collide terrain only. Mutually exclusive with other collision flags.
|16    | Collide instances and terrain. Mutually exclusive with other collision flags.
|32   | Collide with wheels (i.e. you can drive on the banger instance), also not considered an obstacle to AI anymore
|64    | Collide instances and terrain, high priority (no despawn). Mutually exclusive with other collision flags.

### Tags of the dgBangerData block

The *BirthRule* block is the same as used in the
[asBirthRule](asBirthRule.md) files used to define particle
effects caused by player vehicles.

The image files for particle effects are named `fxptN.tex` where *N* is
an integer. MM2 has files from index one to index 16, excluding index
15. It is uncertain if more files can be added, but at least 15 might
be re-instated for new particle textures. See
[asBirthRule](asBirthRule.md) for more details.

*Billboarding* an object or an image means that it is always rotated so
that it faces the camera regardless of the actual orientation of the
object. The flags may apply restrictions to this, such as only allowing
rotation around the Y-axis, etc.
