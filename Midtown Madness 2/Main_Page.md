more than welcome to take part in those discussions.

Though the main focus of this site is to give a complete description of
file formats and their use for software developers, some of the
information and software presented here can also be used in a more
artistic manner. You can actually make your game modifications with some
of these directly.

The goal of this site is to stimulate software developers to make new
software, or adapt existing software to enable complete and
user-friendly creation of modifications of Midtown Madness 2. The idea
is that these modifications will be made according to the rules set up
